This code groups the data based on identifier where data is merged on an excel file
Like this:
Identifier | User
123         | abc
            | def
            | ghi
            | jkl

456         | mno
            | pqr
            | stu


Make sure to unmerge the identifier first from excel and then run the code
this code copies value from the proceeding cell to the blank rows below (after unmerging)
